**This project includes developing a hand gesture recognition model that can accurately identify and classify different hand gestures from image or video data, enabling intuitive human-computer interaction and gesture-based control systems. While creating this model, I learned how to use libraries and algorithms like Keras, Tensorflow and cv2.**
